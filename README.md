# Face_Mask_Detector
Developed an AI-based face mask detection system using Python and deep learning techniques, contributing to public health efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Achieved high precision and real-time detection, integrating with video streams and CCTV systems for efficient monitoring. I have trained the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV. 
Collected and preprocessed a diverse dataset of facial images with and without masks to ensure model robustness.
Employed OpenCV to detect faces in real-time video streams and applied the trained model to classify each face as wearing a mask or not.
